# cse237-project
What user stories were completed this iteration?

We completed a GUI and finished the structure of our project (classes, interfaces, etc.) 


What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

We plan to continue working on our exercise list (providing more options) and updating the materials list for each exercise. 
Also planning on implementing a reroll button and being able to click on an exercise to see details. We would like to clean up the functionality a bit more so that the exercises picked aren't purely random.


Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

Everything we implemented should be working, except if you press the "Previous button in the workouttype window, the program will not show the beginning window and will not terminate. We do force the workout to be at least 10 minutes without informing the user, and we do not properly handle the case of such a long workout that the UI does not fit all the exercises.


What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)

If you change directory (cd) into the project, there should be a "main.sh" script file. If you chmod its permissions to be executable then run it, it will compile and run the program.
