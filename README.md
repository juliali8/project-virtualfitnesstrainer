# cse237-project
What user stories were completed this iteration?

We have completed the user story where the user can click on a more detailed view of the description. This more detailed view provides how long that exercise would take, how many reps (if applicable), and a photo that shows how to do the exercise. Along with that, we have added and made our Junit tests more extensive. 


Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

Everything we implemented should be working fine. We force the workout to be at least 10 minutes without informing the user, and we do not properly handle the case of such a long workout that the UI does not fit all the exercises.


What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)

If you change directory (cd) into the project, there should be a "main.sh" script file. If you chmod its permissions to be executable then run it, it will compile and run the program.
