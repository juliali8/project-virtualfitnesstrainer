# cse237-project
What user stories were completed this iteration?

We have completed the user story where the user can press a re-roll button if the user doesnâ€™t like the workout. We also completed the user story where the user can expect a wide variety of workouts. We will also continue to add to the exercise list to provide an even greater list of workouts. We completed Junit tests which ensure that we can make sure the software we push out to users is accurate, and so users can see if it is. 

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

We intend to complete the user story where the user can click on an exercise and see more details about that exercise. So far, the information given by this detailed view is lacking. We are also building a new algorithm to select exercises to ensure that the workout is optimal and never boring. We also intend to fix the bugs that have been haunting us for the final iteration of this project. We hope to roll out a clean working program in the next two weeks.


Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

Everything we implemented should be working, except if you press the "Previous button in the workouttype window, the program will not show the beginning window and will not terminate. We do force the workout to be at least 10 minutes without informing the user, and we do not properly handle the case of such a long workout that the UI does not fit all the exercises.


What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)

If you change directory (cd) into the project, there should be a "main.sh" script file. If you chmod its permissions to be executable then run it, it will compile and run the program.
